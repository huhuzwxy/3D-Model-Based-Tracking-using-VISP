# 3D-Model-Based-Tracking-using-VISP
We have done 3D model object detection, tracking, computing pose using VISP library. We had seen great advantages of this library as we can track and detect using a single line of code and the data structures defined for holding data are well defined and the class and methods used in the library are well documented with many examples.
